            <p>My coding adventures began with COBOL, thanks to the big Y2K scare.  
                I was hired at Travelers Insurance Company, trained for 8 weeks in COBOL, 
                and then placed in a job fixing date fields to accept a 4 digit number.  
                After 3 years, I was ready to learn more and was hired at Liberty Mutual, 
                again into a training program.  This time I was exposed to both front-end 
                and back-end technology.  Once my training program was completed, I was placed 
                in a position where I was mostly working with java.  I worked in this group for 
                4 years until my daughter was born.  I have dedicated my time since then to 
                raising my kids, but I am now ready to get my head back in some code!</p>
